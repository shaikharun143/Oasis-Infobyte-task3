Idea: Random Password Generator



Description:



For Beginners: Create a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.



For Advanced: Develop an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt. Enhance it by including options for password complexity, adherence to security rules, and clipboard integration for easy copying.



Key Concepts and Challenges:

1)Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
2)User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
3) Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
4)GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for password generation.
5)Security Rules (for Advanced): Implement rules for generating strong, secure passwords.
6)Clipboard Integration (for Advanced): Allow users to copy generated passwords to the clipboard for convenience.
7)Customization (for Advanced): Enable users to customize password generation further, e.g., excluding specific characters.
