Idea: BMI Calculator

Project Description:

For Beginners: Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and category to the user.



For Advanced: Develop a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Allow users to input weight and height, calculate BMI, and visualize the result. Enable data storage for multiple users, historical data viewing, and BMI trend analysis through statistics and graphs.



Key Concepts and Challenges:

User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully.
BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.
Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.
GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays.
Data Storage (for Advanced): Implement user data storage, possibly using file storage or a small database.
Data Visualization (for Advanced): Visualize historical BMI data with graphs or charts.
Error Handling (for Advanced): Address potential issues with data storage or retrieval.
User Experience (for Advanced): Ensure a responsive and user-friendly GUI with clear instructions and feedback.




Project 2 Proposal 



Python Programming

Idea: Random Password Generator



Description:



For Beginners: Create a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.



For Advanced: Develop an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt. Enhance it by including options for password complexity, adherence to security rules, and clipboard integration for easy copying.



Key Concepts and Challenges:

Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for password generation.
Security Rules (for Advanced): Implement rules for generating strong, secure passwords.
Clipboard Integration (for Advanced): Allow users to copy generated passwords to the clipboard for convenience.
Customization (for Advanced): Enable users to customize password generation further, e.g., excluding specific characters.
